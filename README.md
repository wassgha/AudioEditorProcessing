# Audio Editing/Mixing Software with Processing

![The Software's UI](http://gharbi.me/images/11124222_10201236571113662_8836829473154978164_o.jpg)

This is a basic audio manipulation software that is written in Processing (Java). The interface is very simple and minimalistic, it uses a custom made drag and drop class (I'll probably post it as a separate Processing sketch later) along with a custom made contextual menu class.

The software has multiple options/effects to manipulate sound and mix audio files (MP3 or WAV). Functions include :
- Playing audio files
- Visualizing the sound waves
- Removing silence
- Adding silence
- Amplifying audio or decreasing its volume
- Fade-in and fade-out
- Mixing multiple audio files
- Saving the concatenated files as one audio file
